            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Ben Weiss, and I'm passionate about mobile app development.
                I created this website to share more about my journey, interests, and experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently a 4th-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University, where 
                I have been honing my skills in software development. Throughout my academic 
                journey, I have developed a strong interest in mobile app development, which led me to 
                pursue two internships at Vivint, a company that specializes in smart home technology.

            <p> During my internships I worked on iOS development. Both experiences were incredibly 
                rewarding, allowing me to dive deep into the mobile development lifecycle. I 
                found the process of building intuitive, user-friendly mobile applications 
                fascinating and enjoyed the challenge of making each app perform seamlessly 
                across a range of devices. These internships not only enhanced my technical 
                skills but also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a professional 
                development environment.

            <p> The mobile development field truly captivated my interest, and I am excited to 
                continue in this direction. My upcoming full-time job will involve Android development, 
                where I will have the opportunity to further expand my knowledge and contribute to 
                creating meaningful mobile solutions. I’m thrilled to take what I’ve learned during my 
                internships and apply it to my future career, and I look forward to continuing my journey 
                in mobile development.
            </p>
