            <h2>iOS Development Process - My Internships</h2>

            <p>
                During my internships, I had the opportunity to dive into mobile development, specifically working on an iOS project.
                One of my first projects was to create a widget for the iOS app. The process involved various stages, from understanding 
                the appâ€™s requirements to designing the user interface and finally coding the functionality. I learned a lot about how 
                important it is to keep the user interface clean and responsive, and how to integrate the widget seamlessly into the 
                main app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second project involved building a search bar for a specific screen. I had to ensure that it was intuitive, 
                fast, and capable of filtering results in real-time. Working with Xcode and Swift was both challenging and exciting, 
                as I had to figure out how to implement features that would work smoothly and efficiently for the users.
            </p>

            <p>
                These internships helped me gain insight into the real-world challenges of mobile development and how to tackle 
                them through coding, debugging, and collaboration with other developers. It solidified my passion for building 
                apps that users interact with every day, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in the field of mobile development.
